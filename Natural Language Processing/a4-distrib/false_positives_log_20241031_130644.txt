He was widely referred to simply as "Triv" by callers and the Cleveland media.</s><s>Career. He was a frequent caller on the "Sportsline" radio show on WTAM AM 1100 (during this period the station was operating under the WWWE call letters). The show was hosted by the acerbic Pete Franklin and dealt with Cleveland sports. Franklin, who would typically cut off most callers, began giving "Mike from Mayfield" some latitude due to knowledgeable commentary, particularly regarding the Cleveland Browns. Franklin began mockingly referring to Trivisonno as "Mr. Know It All," a moniker he would carry into his own radio career. Trivisonno eventually began his own broadcasting career in 1987, working for a time at WNCX, commenting on sports (particularly boxing) and becoming a full-time personality from 1989–1992.

Throughout the program's history, "The Mike Trivisonno Show" was usually either first or second in ratings in its time slot in the market. His show had been originally dedicated mostly to sports, but over time became a forum for discussing sports, politics, local issues, current events, or whatever else was on Trivisonno's mind at the time. He discussed topics (and frequently argued) with listeners who called in to the show and/or with his various producers and sidekicks that worked alongside him. Trivisonno's popularity and high ratings led him to be ranked numerous times among "Talkers Magazine's" "Heavy Hundred", including most recently in 2015, when he came in at #72.
